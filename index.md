## Research Interests

- **Current work:** distributed statistical inference in social interaction networks - how people converge onto an underlying 'true' distribution from limited individual knowledge.

- **Other interests:** How do we integrate emotional information in the context of group social interactions? How do our affective cues signal our allegiances?
